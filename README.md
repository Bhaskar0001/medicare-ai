- **Laboratory Management**: Centralized test request queue and result entry system.
- **Financial Suite**: Complete billing, invoice management, and insurance claim tracking.
- **Inventory Control**: Predictive reordering and high-fidelity tracking of hospital supplies.
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Secure access for Admins, Doctors, Executives, and Billing staff.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React (Vite), Tailwind CSS, Lucide React, Recharts, Sonner (Toasts).
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js.
- **Database**: MongoDB (Mongoose).
- **Security**: JWT Authentication, Helmet, Rate Limiting, Compression.

## 🔐 Credentials (Demo Accounts)

You can use the following credentials to explore the different roles within MediFlow AI:

| Role | Email | Password |
|------|-------|----------|
| **Executive** | `executive@mediflow.com` | `admin123` |
| **Admin** | `admin@mediflow.com` | `admin123` |
| **Doctor** | `doctor@mediflow.com` | `admin123` |
| **Billing** | `billing@mediflow.com` | `admin123` |

## 🛠️ Installation & Setup

### 1. Prerequisite
- Node.js (v18+)
- MongoDB Connection URI

### 2. Backend Setup
```bash
cd server
npm install
# Create a .env file based on .env configuration
npm run dev
```

### 3. Frontend Setup
```bash
cd client
npm install
npm run dev
```

## 🏗️ Production Readiness
The application is optimized for production with:
- Environment variable separation (`.env.production` vs `.env.development`).
- Hardened security headers via Helmet.
- API response compression.
- Request rate-limiting to prevent abuse.

## 🏗️ System Architecture


MediFlow AI uses a simple and secure **Three-Tier Architecture**:

1.  **Frontend (UI)**: A fast React-based interface using Tailwind CSS for a modern, responsive user experience.
2.  **Backend (API)**: A Node.js and Express server that handles all business logic, security, and data processing.
3.  **Database**: A secure MongoDB cluster that stores all patient, billing, and inventory records.

## 🔄 Application Flow

The system follows a logical 4-step process to manage patient care:

1.  **Registration**: Front desk staff check in the patient and create or update their digital file.
2.  **Consultation**: Doctors record vitals, symptoms, and clinical notes directly into the EMR.
3.  **Diagnosis & Labs**: Doctors order tests; the AI engine provides real-time insights and supply alerts.
4.  **Billing & Discharge**: The system automatically generates invoices and processes discharge papers.

## 💡 Real-World Problems vs. MediFlow Solutions

MediFlow AI is engineered to solve the most pressing challenges in modern healthcare administration.

| The Clinical Pain Point | The MediFlow Solution |
|-------------------------|-----------------------|
| **Data Fragmentation**: Clinical data trapped in legacy silos. | **Unified Data Fabric**: Single-source EMR integrating Lab, Billing, and History. |
| **Inventory Black Holes**: Medicines expiring or running out unnoticed. | **Predictive Supply Chain**: AI forecasts demand and alerts reorders automatically. |
| **Document Fatigue**: Doctors overwhelmed by administrative data entry. | **Smart Clinical Workflow**: Role-specific dashboards focusing on patient-priority data. |
| **Billing Leakage**: Missed charges due to poor link between clinical work and finance. | **Automated Revenue Integrity**: Real-time billing triggers based on clinical actions. |
| **Cyber Vulnerability**: Healthcare data prone to ransomware and theft. | **Zero-Trust Hardening**: JWT Auth, Security Headers, and SSL-encrypted DB connections. |
